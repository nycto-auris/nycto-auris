- SDC - Dropped 24% on missing earnings by around 25 million and now a class action has been started. Seems to have found some support around 5.10. With a float of 103mil, for me personally, this would be a swing trade if I were to enter. I could see this thing dropping another level to test all time lows down at 3.65 and maybe bounce. If the class action turns out not to stick then the 32.5% short % is going to be squeezy.  

- LITB - Another large float for me at 103mil. Today, bouncing off 1.24 support back from August, LITB took a shot at breaking above 50day which also looks to lineup with some previous support at 1.84. It appears it had possibly the largest volume to date with a 8907.51% increase from its average vol...WTF!? During market hours it was not able hold above its 50day 1.84. Looking for momentum to continue and see if it can hold and then move up to test 200 day up at 2.65.
