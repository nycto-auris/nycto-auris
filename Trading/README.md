# Trading

> This is my space for notes, trading journal entries, links to resources, documentation and anything else I use for trading so that they are accesbile via web, backed up, so I can take advantage of Visual Studio Code as an awesome app and teach myself git for a possible tech career and even just to stay sharp and have fun.
