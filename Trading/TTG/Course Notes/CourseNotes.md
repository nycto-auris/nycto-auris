### What is the stock market? ### 
- Collection of buyers and sellers of stocks or other securities which represent ownership claims on business. 

### What is an Exchange? ###
- An exchange is a marketplace where securities, commodities and other things are traded. Exchanges give companies, governments and other groups a platform which to sell securities to the public.

### What is equity and why is it important? ###
- Equity is important because it represents the real value of your actual stake in an investment. Investors who hold stock in a compnay are usually focused on their own personal equity in the company. This is represented by the shares that are owned. This kind of personal equity is a function of the total equity of the company itself, meaning that a shareholder concerned for their own earnings will necessarily be concerned for the company itself.

### Types of Trades
- Price Types
    - Market:buy or sell a security at the best current price
    - Market on Close: buy or sell a security as a market order as close to possible to the close of the trading of the day.

### Tier Trading Strategy ###

- Originally designed to help funds enter and exit very large positions, the tier system can help retail traders improve risk management while maximzing their reward. The concept behind it is to enter and exit trades in stages rather than all at once.

    - Why Tier Trading in and out?
        - Stay in winning trades longer
        - Exit losing trades while they are still small losses

    - Typically 3 tiers or on exiting the last teir break it up as needed. 

    
    - Entry

        - T1 25% of full position size
            - "feeler" 
            - Usually entered close to support levels, areas of consolidation, or prior to breakout from a developing pattern. 
            - Think of it as paying a small toll or fee to see if you are correct with your analysis. The 1st tier also gets you a nicer lower average cost if you are right but keeps your loss small if you are wrong. 

        - T2 50% size but 75% total size
            - Bulk of your size.
            - you entier tier 2 when you get confirmation of your thesis or pattern, or when it begins to work in your favor. 
            - T2 can be entered on a breakout of a chart or a successful restest of a key support level.
        
        *** it can also be useful to enter in 2 teirs, so t1=25% and t2=75%.

        *** it can also be useful to think of these tiers as separate trades by placing your t1 stop loss looser and your T2 stop loss much tighter.

        *** depending on your style majority of your trades could even not be teired entries

        - T3 
            - Icing on the cake
            - After T2 is entered and everyting is working in your favor.
            - You do not have to get to your t3 on every trade. 
            - T3 can also be a reload after a retest and hold on a breakout continuation move. 

    - Exit

        - T1 - 25%
            - Typically you will have entered T1 in front of a support level so use that as your exit if it breaks below that support. Cut your losses while they are small.
            - If you are wrong and a trade fails after having entered T2/T3, taking T1 off the table early can help minimize your net loss or even cause you to break even on the trade. 
            - If you are in T2/T3 and the trade is working, TAKE T1 PROFIT. This is right after you enter T3 and the stock moved in your favor. Lock profits in. this makes it easier to hold through pullbacks and chop later on. 

            *** taking a T1 at high of day is prudent
        
        - T2 - 50%
            - As the stock moves in your favor look to sell T2 right before the next resistence level or your price target. Don't get greedy. Especially if you still have your T3, less stress.
            - In a cold market, you should exit in two tiers due to lack of followthrough. 

        - T3 - 25%
            - After T1/T2 have been exited sell T3 if the stock makes another new high or if momentum slows or shows weakness in the trend. 

### TTG Triangle(ABCD) ###

- Morning Setup
    - Checklist
        - Strong stock
            - The TTG triangle forms mostly on strong stocks that gap up in the morning and/or off news catalyst with out of ordinary volume. 
        - Initila Morning High(IMH)
            - The first pullback in the morning, real pullback, on a 3/5min chart. Wait for a pullback
        - High Volume Break
            - After the IMH you want to see big volume breakup up through the IMH. The higher the vol the better chance IMH has of becoming support.
        - Initial High Support
            - Look for IMH to become support. You want to see it bounce, trade above, and establish a support area.
        - Down Trend Resistance Line
            - You want to see lower highs that create a down trend line with decreasing volume. this creates a descending trianlge above the initial morning high support level.
        - Down Trend Reistance Breakout
            - You want to see the stock break the trend with an increase in volume. The heavier the vol the better chance you have a continuation and followthrough. 
            - A good 1st take profit can be in front of HOD. 

- Trade Execution
    - Buying
        - Once the IMH has been broken through and confirmed support with a strong quick tail you can then go long with your stop loss below IMH.
        - Preferrably you want to enter a T1 position as close to support of IMH as possible but you need to see strong volume when that IMH is broken. If not then the TTG Triangle has a greater chance of failing. The stronger the break, the better the odds of IMH becoming support and the pattern triggering.
        - If the stock holds above the IMH with a strong tail on lower volume, making lower highs, then breaks out of that trend/pattern, then you can add T2 and/or T3 as volume increases for confirmation.
        - If things are moving very quickly then its find to enter T1 and T2 inside the triangle then add on the break out. make sure to use the same stop.
        - Once you have a breakout on strong vol you can then add your T3 after the new hod.
        
    - Selling
        - After a stock has broken out its safe to sell a T1 to ensure minimal losess. 
        - Volume is your indicator on when to take profit. If you get very strong volume then you can your T2. 
        - Once you are down to your T3, see if the vol is still increasing. If it is, then hold onto your T3 for the follow through and bump your stop up to below the previous high. 
        - do not wait for the stock to pull in to sell your final position. Sell on the exstension.

- Afternoon Setup
    - The afternoon setup is based on a previous hod where the morning is based on the IMH. 
    - These setups will pullback and float around on low lunchtime volume. This give your much more time to find your entry and get in closer to support.
